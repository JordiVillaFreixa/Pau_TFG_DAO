# Using tleap to prepare the calculations

## Simulation of DAO with TPQ without NAG

```
cd prepare
tleap -f tleap_dao_noNAG.in >tleap_dao_noNAG.out
```

## Simulation of DAO with TPQ without NAG with a different number of trehalose molecules

A script `tleap_dao_noNAG_TRE.sh` has been created to generate the different leap input files.
