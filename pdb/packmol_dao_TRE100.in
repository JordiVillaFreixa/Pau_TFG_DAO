# in order to know the size of the box where to put the trehalose molecules, we use the info from 
# tleap -f tleap_dao_noNAG.in > tleap_dao_noNAG.log
# which provides the bounding box of the trehalose free MD run, that we wish to maintain:
#   Total bounding box for atom centers:  104.841 102.718 137.764
# so, we take as the lower and upper coordinates of the box:
# Xmin=22.864-104.841/2=-29.557
# Xmax=22.864+104.841/2=75.285
# Ymin=51.270-102.718/2=-0.089
# Ymax=51.270+102.718/2=102.629
# Zmin=2.541-137.764/2=-66.341
# Zmax=2.541+137.764/2=71.423
