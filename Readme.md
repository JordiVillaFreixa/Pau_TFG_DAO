# Effect of trehalose on the stability of DAO

Work adapted from Pau Domínguez ([pauds01](https://github.com/pauds01)) [repo](https://github.com/pauds01/TFG_DAO) during his BSc final research work at the Degree of Biotecnology, Faculty of Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya. The work has been taken for completion by [Jordi Villà](https://github.com/JordiVillaFreixa) in  [this repo](https://github.com/JordiVillaFreixa/Pau_TFG_DAO).

## Structure of this repo

* `pdb`: folder containing all original and modified pdb files, along with transformation scripts
* `prepare`: folder containing all preparation files for the simulations
* `inputs`: folder containing all the input files for simulation
* `lib`: folder containing all the libs needed to run the simulations
* `scripts`: scripts controlling all steps in the calculations, including the scrpts needed to submit MD runs
* `results`: a folder containing results files if not very large (not trajectories nor restart files)
* `analysis`: folder containing all the final analysis results using jupyter notebooks and alike

All results are located in local folders controlled by the variable `SCRATCHDIR`. The script that sets this variable should be generated by the user and needs to reside in each machine. An example is provided in `scripts/set_scratchdir.sh.example`. The user needs to `cp` such file in the desired directory and then source it by adding this line to the shell profile file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` in ubuntu, or `.zshrc` in Mac OS):
```
source /path/to/set_scratchdir.sh
```

## Installing needed software

### AMBER

Download the last versions of Amber and AmberTools from the [AMBER web site](https://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php). Then:

```
bunzip2 Amber*.bz2
tar xvf Amber<version>.tar 
tar xvf AmberTools<version>.tar 
mkdir ~/Software
mv amber<version>_src/ ~/Software/
cd ~/Software/amber<version>_src/build
./run_cmake
make install
```

NOTE: if you want to install the `<>.MPI` or `<>.CUDA` versions of the executables, you need to edit the `run_cmake` and set `TRUE` the corresponding flags for your architecture.

After installation, add this line to your shell profile:

```
source $HOME/software/amber<version>/amber.sh
```
