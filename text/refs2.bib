Electron-density difference maps and crystallographic refinement provide unequivocal evidence for a number of Xe-binding sites in each enzyme. Only one of these sites is present in all three Cu amine oxidases studied. Structural changes elsewhere in the protein molecules are insignificant. The results illustrate the use of xenon as a probe for cavities, in which a protein may accommodate a dioxygen molecule. The finding of a potential dioxygen-binding cavity close to the active site of Cu amine oxidases may be relevant to the function of the enzymes, since the formation of a transient protein–dioxygen complex is a likely step in the catalytic mechanism. No evidence was found for xenon binding in a region of the molecule that was previously identified in two other Cu amine oxidases as a potential transient dioxygen-binding site.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated a key enzyme encoded by the gene copper amine oxidase (MaCAO), which is involved in the biosynthetic pathway of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ)1, an active ingredient in mulberry leaves. The 1680 bp long MaCAO was successfully cloned (GenBank accession no: MH205733). Subsequently, MaCAO was heterologously expressed using a recombinant plasmid, pET-22b (+)/MaCAO in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). A protein with a molecular mass of 62.9 kDa was obtained, whose function was validated through enzymatic reaction. Bioinformatics analysis identified that MaCAO contained the same conserved domain as that of copper amine oxidases (“NYDY”). Furthermore, the tertiary structure of the predicted protein using homology modeling revealed 46\% similarity with that of copper amine oxidase (Protein Data Bank ID: 1W2Z). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the enzymatic reaction revealed that MaCAO could catalyze 1,5-pentanediamine to produce 5-aminopentanal. Additionally, levels of mulberry leaf DNJ content were significantly positively correlated with expression levels of MaCAO (P {\textless} 0.001). Our results conclude that MaCAO is the key enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway of DNJ. The function of MaCAO is validated, providing a foundation for the further analysis of biosynthetic pathways of DNJ in mulberry leaves using tools of synthetic biology.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used extensively to study P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a flexible multidrug transporter that is a key player in the development of multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutics. A substantial body of literature has grown from simulation studies that have employed various simulation conditions and parameters, including AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, GROMOS, and coarse-grained force fields, drawing conclusions from simulations spanning hundreds of nanoseconds. Each force field is typically parametrized and validated on different data and observables, usually of small molecules and peptides; there have been few comparisons of force field performance on large protein–membrane systems. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of P-gp embedded in a POPC/cholesterol bilayer generated over 500 ns of replicate simulation with five force fields from popular biomolecular families: AMBER 99SB-ILDN, CHARMM 36, OPLS-AA/L, GROMOS 54A7, and MARTINI. We find considerable differences among the ensembles with little conformational overlap, although they correspond to similar extents to structural data obtained from electron paramagnetic resonance and cross-linking studies. Moreover, each trajectory was still sampling new conformations at a high rate after 500 ns of simulation, suggesting the need for more sampling. This work highlights the need to consider known limitations of the force field used (e.g., biases toward certain secondary structures) and the simulation itself (e.g., whether sufficient sampling has been achieved) when interpreting accumulated results of simulation studies of P-gp and other transport proteins.},

The AMBER force field is widely used and has well-defined bond length, bond angle, partial charge, and van der Waals parameters for all the common amino acids and nucleotides, but it lacks parameters for many of the modifications found in nucleic acids and proteins. Presently there are 107 known naturally occurring modifications that play important roles in RNA stability, folding, and other functions. Modified nucleotides are found in almost all transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs of both the small and large subunits, and in many other functional RNAs. We developed force field parameters for the 107 modified nucleotides currently known to be present in RNA. The methodology used for deriving the modified nucleotide parameters is consistent with the methods used to develop the Cornell et al. force field. These parameters will improve the functionality of AMBER so that simulations can now be readily performed on diverse RNAs having post-transcriptional modifications.},

	abstract = {P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the ATP binding cassette superfamily of transporters, and it is a xenobiotic efflux pump that limits intracellular drug accumulation by pumping compounds out of cells. P-gp contributes to a reduction in toxicity, and has broad substrate specificity. It is involved in the failure of many cancer and antiviral chemotherapies due to the phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR), in which the membrane transporter removes chemotherapeutic drugs from target cells. Understanding the details of the ligand–P-gp interaction is therefore critical for the development of drugs that can overcome the MDR phenomenon, for the early identification of P-gp substrates that will help us to obtain a more effective prediction of toxicity, and for the subsequent outdesign of substrate properties if needed. In this work, a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of human P-gp (hP-gp) in an explicit membrane-and-water environment were performed to investigate the effects of binding different compounds on the conformational dynamics of P-gp. The results revealed significant differences in the behaviour of P-gp in the presence of active and non-active compounds within the binding pocket, as different patterns of movement were identified that could be correlated with conformational changes leading to the activation of the translocation mechanism. The predicted ligand–P-gp interactions are in good agreement with the available experimental data, as well as the estimation of the binding-free energies of the studied complexes, demonstrating the validity of the results derived from the MD simulations.},

The broad diversity of biochemical functions that carbohydrates cover is a direct consequence of the variety of 3D architectures they can adopt, displaying branched or linear arrangements, widely ranging in sizes, and with the highest diversity of building blocks of any other natural biopolymer. Despite this unparalleled complexity, a common denominator can be found in the glycans’ inherent flexibility, which hinders experimental characterization, but that can be addressed by high-performance computing (HPC)-based molecular simulations. In this short review, I present and discuss the state-of-the-art of molecular simulations of complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates, highlighting methodological strengths and weaknesses, important insights through emblematic case studies, and suggesting perspectives for future developments.},

Using this method, it is possible to identify sites affected by varying simulation conditions and reveal the path of propagation of the effect even when differences between the 3D structure of the molecule and the fluctuation RMSF of each residue is unclear. MDContactCom can monitor differences in complex protein dynamics between two MD trajectories and identify candidate sites to be analyzed in more detail.

Coupling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) assay offered a simple, rapid, and direct approach in monitoring the protein-protein binding process and predicting the binding affinity. Our case study of designed ankyrin repeats proteins (DARPins)—AnkGAG1D4 and the single point mutated AnkGAG1D4-Y56A for HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) were investigated. As reported, AnkGAG1D4 bound with CA for inhibitory activity; however, it lost its inhibitory strength when tyrosine at residue 56 AnkGAG1D4, the most key residue was replaced by alanine (AnkGAG1D4-Y56A). Through NTA, the binding of DARPins and CA was measured by monitoring the increment of the hydrodynamic radius of the AnkGAG1D4-gold conjugated nanoparticles (AnkGAG1D4-GNP) and AnkGAG1D4-Y56A-GNP upon interaction with CA in buffer solution. The size of the AnkGAG1D4-GNP increased when it interacted with CA but not AnkGAG1D4-Y56A-GNP. In addition, a much higher binding free energy (∆GB) of AnkGAG1D4-Y56A (−31 kcal/mol) obtained from MD further suggested affinity for CA completely reduced compared to AnkGAG1D4 (−60 kcal/mol). The possible mechanism of the protein-protein binding was explored in detail by decomposing the binding free energy for crucial residues identification and hydrogen bond analysis.},

	abstract = {The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) has a critical role in the development and preservation of the nervous system. However, tau’s dysfunction and accumulation in the human brain can lead to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Down’s syndrome, and frontotemporal dementia. The microtubule binding (MTB) domain plays a significant, important role in determining the tau’s pathophysiology, as the core of paired helical filaments PHF6* (275VQIINK280) and PHF6 (306VQIVYK311) of R2 and R3 repeat units, respectively, are formed in this region, which promotes tau aggregation. Posttranslational modifications, and in particular lysine acetylation at K280 of PHF6* and K311 of PHF6, have been previously established to promote tau misfolding and aggregation. However, the exact aggregation mechanism is not known. In this study, we established an atomic-level nucleation-extension mechanism of the separated aggregation of acetylated PHF6* and PHF6 hexapeptides, respectively, of tau. We show that the acetylation of the lysine residues promotes the formation of β-sheet enriched high-ordered oligomers. The Markov state model analysis of ac-PHF6* and ac-PHF6 aggregation revealed the formation of an antiparallel dimer nucleus which could be extended from both sides in a parallel manner to form mixed-oriented and high-ordered oligomers. Our study describes the detailed mechanism for acetylation-driven tau aggregation, which provides valuable insights into the effect of post-translation modification in altering the pathophysiology of tau hexapeptides.},

Microcalorimetry has found the complex-type N-linked glycan core pentasaccharide ␤-GlcNAc-(132)-␣-Man-(133)-[␤-GlcNAc-(132)-␣-Man-(136)]-Man to bind to the lectin, Concanavalin A, with almost the same affinity as the trimannoside, Man-␣-(136)-[Man-␣-(133)]-Man. Recent determination of the structure of the pentasaccharide complex found a glycosidic linkage ␺ torsion angle to be distorted by 50° from the NMR solution value and perturbation of some key mannose–protein interactions observed in the structures of the mono- and trimannoside complexes. To unravel the free energy contributions to binding and to determine the structural basis for this degeneracy, we present the results of a series of nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations, coupled to analysis via the recently developed MM-GB/SA approach (Srinivasan et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120:9401–9409). These calculations indicate that the strength of key mannose–protein interactions at the monosaccharide site is preserved in both the oligosaccharides. Although distortion of the pentasaccharide is significant, the principal factor in reduced binding is incomplete offset of ligand and protein desolvation due to poorly matched polar interactions. This analysis implies that, although Concanavalin A tolerates the additional 6 arm GlcNAc present in the pentasaccharide, it does not serve as a key recognition determinant.},

Salmonella SseK1 and SseK2 are E. coli NleB1 orthologs that behave as NleB1-like GTs, although they differ in protein substrate specificity. Here we report that these enzymes are retaining glycosyltransferases composed of a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, a lid domain, and a catalytic domain. A conserved HEN motif (His-Glu-Asn) in the active site is important for enzyme catalysis and bacterial virulence. We observe differences between SseK1 and SseK2 in interactions with substrates and identify substrate residues that are critical for enzyme recognition. Long Molecular Dynamics simulations suggest that the HLH domain determines substrate specificity and the lid-domain regulates the opening of the active site. Overall, our data suggest a front-face SNi mechanism, explain differences in activities among these effectors, and have implications for future drug development against enteric pathogens.},

N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) deficiency is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental delay, peripheral neuropathy, elevated liver transaminases, hyperkinetic movement disorder and (hypo)-alacrima. We demonstrate that N-acetylglucosamine-asparagine (GlcNAc-Asn; GNA), is the analyte most closely associated with NGLY1 deficiency, showing consistent separation in levels between patients and controls. GNA accumulation is directly linked to the absence of functional NGLY1, presenting strong potential for its use as a biomarker. In agreement, a quantitative liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assay, developed to assess GNA from 3 to 3000 ng/ml, showed that it is conserved as a marker for loss of NGLY1 function in NGLY1-deficient cell lines, rodents (urine, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and tissues) and patients (plasma and urine). Elevated GNA levels differentiate patients from controls, are stable over time and correlate with changes in NGLY1 activity. GNA as a biomarker has the potential to identify and validate patients with NGLY1 deficiency, act as a direct pharmacodynamic marker and serve as a potential surrogate endpoint in clinical trials.,

Recent breakthroughs in protein purification strategies and current proteome technologies make it possible to identify the proteomics of healthy and diseased retinas. Despite these advantages, the research field identifying sets of posttranslationally modified proteins (PTMomes) related to diseased retinas is significantly lagging, despite knowledge of the major retina PTMome being critical to drug development. In this review, we highlight current updates regarding the PTMomes in three retinal degenerative diseases—namely, diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A literature search reveals the necessity to expedite investigations into essential PTMomes in the diseased retina and validate their physiological roles. This knowledge would accelerate the development of treatments for retinal degenerative disorders and the prevention of blindness in affected populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship of immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation with diabetes and diabetic nephropathy has been reported, but its role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate and validate the association of IgG glycosylation with DR.
METHODS: We analyzed the IgG N-linked glycosylation profile and primarily selected candidate glycans by lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression analysis in the discovery population. The findings were validated in the replication population using a binary logistics model. The association between the significant glycosylation panel and clinical features was illustrated with Spearman's coefficient. The results were confirmed by sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Among 16 selected glycan candidates using lasso, two IgG glycans (GP15, GP20) and two derived traits (IGP32, IGP54) were identified and validated to be significantly associated with DR (P {\textless} .05), and the combined adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 0.587, 0.613, 1.970, and 0.593, respectively. The glycosylation panel showed a weak correlation with clinical features, except for age. In addition, the results remained consistent when the subjects with prediabetes were excluded from the controls, and the adjusted ORs were 0.677, 0.738, 1.597, and 0.678 in the whole population. Furthermore, in the 1:3 rematched population, a significant association was observed, apart from GP20.
CONCLUSIONS: The IgG glycosylation profile, reflecting an aging and pro-inflammatory status, was significantly associated with DR. The variation in the IgG glycome deserves more attention in diabetic complications.},

Previous work shows that its content is significantly reduced in the rat retina by streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetes. This study tested the hypothesis that STZ-diabetes alters synaptophysin protein turnover and glycosylation in the rat retina. Whole explant retinas from male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Rats were made diabetic by a single intraperitoneal STZ injection (65 mg/kg body weight in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5). mRNA translation was measured using a 35S-methionine labeling assay followed by synaptophysin immunoprecipitation and autoradiography. A pulse-chase study was used to determine the depletion of newly synthesized synaptophysin. Depletion of total synaptophysin was determined after treatment with cycloheximide. Mannose rich N-glycosylated synaptophysin was detected by treating retinal lysates with endoglycosidase H followed by immunoblot analysis. Synaptophysin mRNA translation was significantly increased after 1 month (p{\textless}0.001) and 2 months (p{\textless}0.05) of STZ-diabetes, compared to age-matched controls. Newly synthesized synaptophysin degradation was significantly accelerated in the retina after 1 and 2 months of diabetes compared to controls (p{\textless}0.05). Mannose rich glycosylated synaptophysin was significantly increased after 1 month of STZ-diabetes compared to controls (p{\textless}0.05).These data suggest that diabetes increases mRNA translation of synaptophysin in the retina, resulting in an accumulation of mannose rich glycosylated synaptophysin, a transient post-translational state of the protein. This diabetes-induced irregularity in post-translational processing could explain the accelerated degradation of retinal synaptophysin in diabetes.},

Numerous studies have confirmed that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the occurrence and progression of cancers in multiple systems throughout the body. It is also involved in regulating multiple cancer hallmarks, such as metabolic reprogramming, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.

O-Linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a dynamic nucleocytoplasmic modification more analogous to phosphorylation than to classical complex O-glycosylation. We describe a mass spectrometry-based method for the identification of sites modified by O-GlcNAc that relies on mild β-elimination followed by Michael addition with dithiothreitol (BEMAD). Using synthetic peptides, we also show that biotin pentylamine can replace dithiothreitol as the nucleophile. The modified peptides can be efficiently enriched by affinity chromatography, and the sites can be mapped using tandem mass spectrometry. This same methodology can be applied to mapping sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation, and we provide a strategy that uses modification-specific antibodies and enzymes to discriminate between the two post-translational modifications. The BEMAD methodology was validated by mapping three previously identified O-GlcNAc sites, as well as three novel sites, on Synapsin I purified from rat brain. BEMAD was then used on a purified nuclear pore complex preparation to map novel sites of O-GlcNAc modification on the Lamin B receptor and the nucleoporin Nup155. This method is amenable for performing quantitative mass spectrometry and can also be adapted to quantify cysteine residues. In addition, our studies emphasize the importance of distinguishing between O-phosphate versus O-GlcNAc when mapping sites of serine and threonine post-translational modification using β-elimination/Michael addition methods.},

High glycan conformational freedom hinders complete structural elucidation of glycoproteins. Computer simulations may be used to model glycosylated proteins but require hundreds of thousands of computing hours on supercomputers, thus limiting routine use. Here, we describe GlycoSHIELD, a reductionist method that can be implemented on personal computers to graft realistic ensembles of glycan conformers onto static protein structures in minutes. Using molecular dynamics simulation, small-angle X-ray scattering, cryoelectron microscopy, and mass spectrometry, we show that this open-access toolkit provides enhanced models of glycoprotein structures.

Here we have investigated the effects of glycosylation on the thermostability of Bacillus subtilis xylanase A (XynA) expressed in Pichia pastoris. Intact mass analysis of the heterologous wild-type XynA revealed two, three, or four Hex8–16GlcNAc2 modifications involving asparagine residues at positions 20, 25, 141, and 181. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the XynA modified with various combinations of branched Hex9GlcNAc2 at these positions indicated a significant contribution from protein-glycan interactions to the overall energy of the glycoproteins. The effect of glycan content and glycosylation position on protein stability was evaluated by combinatorial mutagenesis of all six potential N-glycosylation sites. The majority of glycosylated enzymes expressed in P. pastoris presented increased thermostability in comparison with their unglycosylated counterparts expressed in Escherichia coli. Steric effects of multiple glycosylation events were apparent, and glycosylation position rather than the number of glycosylation events determined increases in thermostability. The MD simulations also indicated that clustered glycan chains tended to favor less stabilizing glycan-glycan interactions, whereas more dispersed glycosylation patterns favored stabilizing protein-glycan interactions. Background: The molecular basis of increased protein stability by N-glycosylation is incompletely understood. Results: Glycosylation position rather than number is more important for protein thermostability in the xylanase A from Bacillus subtilis. Conclusion: Glycans contribute both to stabilizing protein-glycan and less favorable glycan-glycan interactions. An extensive protein-glycan interface favors protein stability. Significance: Formation of a protein-glycan interface provides a conceptual framework to understand glycoprotein stabilization.},

We have produced the three individual glycoforms that display the core heptasaccharide, Man5GlcNAc2, and analyzed the structure of each glycoform by using small-angle X-ray scattering along with molecular dynamics simulations. The glycan on Asn34 is relatively compact and rigid, donates hydrogen bonds that “cap” the carbonyl groups at the C-terminus of an α-helix, and enhances protein thermostability. In contrast, the glycan on Asn88 is flexible and can even enter the enzymic active site, hindering catalysis. The N-glycosylation of Asn76 has less pronounced consequences. These data highlight the diverse behaviors of Man5GlcNAc2 pendants and provide a structural underpinning to the functional consequences of protein glycosylation.},

	abstract = {Although glycosylation appears to protect prion protein (PrPC) from the conformational transition to the disease-associated scrapie form (PrPSc), available NMR structures are for non-glycosylated PrPC, only. To investigate the influence of both the two N-linked glycans, Asn181 and Asn197, and of the GPI anchor attached to Ser230, on the structural, dynamical and electrostatic behavior of PrP, we have undertaken molecular dynamics simulations on the C-terminal region of human prion protein HuPrP(90–230), with and without the three glycans. The simulations used the AMBER94 force field in a periodic box model with explicit water molecules, considering all long-range electrostatic interactions. The results suggest the structured part of the protein, HuPrP(127–227) is stabilized overall from addition of the glycans, specifically by extensions of Helix-B and Helix-C and reduced flexibility of the linking turn containing Asn197, although some regions such as residues in the turn (165–170) between Strand-B and Helix-B have increased flexibility. The stabilization appears indirect, by reducing the mobility of the surrounding water molecules, and not from specific interactions such as H bonds or ion pairs. The results are consistent with glycosylation at Asn197 having a stabilizing role, while that at Asn181, in a region with already stable secondary structure, having a more functional role, in agreement with literature suggestions. Due to three negatively charged SiaLex groups per N-glycan, the surface electrostatic properties change to a negative electrostatic field covering most of the C-terminal part, including the surface of Helix-B and Helix-C, while the positively charged N-terminal part PrP(90–126) of undefined structure creates a positive potential. The unusual hydrophilic Helix-A (144–152) is not covered by either of these dominant electrostatic fields, and modeling shows it could readily dimerize in anti parallel fashion. In combination with separate simulations of the GPI anchor in a membrane model, the results show the GPI anchor is highly flexible and would maintain the protein at a distance between 9 and 13 Å from the membrane surface, with little influence on its structure or orientational freedom.},

The N-glycans that are covalently linked to proteins are involved in numerous biological processes. There is considerable interest in developments of general approaches to predict the structural consequences of site-specific glycosylation and to understand how these effects can be exploited in protein design with advantageous properties. In this study, the impacts of N-glycans on protein structure and dynamics are systematically investigated using an integrated computational approach of the Protein Data Bank structure analysis and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins. Our study reveals that N-glycosylation does not induce significant changes in protein structure, but decreases protein dynamics, likely leading to an increase in protein stability. Overall, these results suggest not only a common role of glycosylation in proteins, but also a need for certain proteins to be properly glycosylated to gain their intrinsic dynamic properties.},

N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification that adds sugar moieties to molecules and can modulate the activity of several immune molecules. Using a TCR-pMHC pair found in melanoma as a case study, our study demonstrates that N-glycosylation of the TCR-pMHC alters the proteins' conformation; increases the bond lifetime; and increases the number of hydrogen bonds and Lennard-Jones Contacts involved in the TCR-pMHC bond. We find that weak glycan-protein or glycan-glycan interactions impact the equilibrated structure of the TCR and pMHC leading to an increase in the overall bond strength of the TCR-pMHC complex including the duration and energetic strength under constant load. These results indicate that N-glycosylation plays an important role in the TCR-pMHC bond and should be considered in future computational and experimental studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

	abstract = {Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are the linear carbohydrate components of proteoglycans (PGs) and are key mediators in the bioactivity of PGs in animal tissue. GAGs are heterogeneous, conformationally complex, and polydisperse, containing up to 200 monosaccharide units. These complexities make studying GAG conformation a challenge for existing experimental and computational methods. We previously described an algorithm we developed that applies conformational parameters (i.e., all bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles) from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of nonsulfated chondroitin GAG 20-mers to construct 3-D atomic-resolution models of nonsulfated chondroitin GAGs of arbitrary length. In the current study, we applied our algorithm to other GAGs, including hyaluronan and nonsulfated forms of dermatan, keratan, and heparan and expanded our database of MD-generated GAG conformations. Here, we show that individual glycosidic linkages and monosaccharide rings in 10- and 20-mers of hyaluronan and nonsulfated dermatan, keratan, and heparan behave randomly and independently in MD simulation and, therefore, using a database of MD-generated 20-mer conformations, that our algorithm can construct conformational ensembles of 10- and 20-mers of various GAG types that accurately represent the backbone flexibility seen in MD simulations. Furthermore, our algorithm efficiently constructs conformational ensembles of GAG 200-mers that we would reasonably expect from MD simulations.},

The X-ray structures for both human enzymes are solved and provide the basis for computer-aided inhibitor design, which has been reported by several research groups. Although the putative off-target effect of hDAO is less studied, computational methods could be easily utilized to avoid the binding of VAP-1-targeted inhibitors to hDAO. The choice of the model organism for preclinical testing of hVAP-1 inhibitors is not either trivial due to species-specific binding properties of designed inhibitors and different repertoire of copper-containing amine oxidase family members in mammalian species. Thus, the facts that should be considered in hVAP-1-targeted inhibitor design are discussed in light of the applied structural bioinformatics and structural biology approaches.},

   abstract = {Excess of histamine in gut lumen generates a pronounced gastrointestinal discomfort, which may include diarrhea and peristalsis dysfunctions. Deleterious effects of histamine can be alleviated with antihistamine drugs targeting histamine receptors. However, many antihistamine agents come with various undesirable side effects. Vegetal diamine oxidase (vDAO) might be a relevant alternative owing to its histaminase activity. Mammalian intestinal mucosa contains an endogenous DAO, yet possessing lower activity compared to that of vDAO preparation. Moreover, in several pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, this endogenous DAO enzyme can be lost or inactivated. Here, we tested the therapeutic potential of vDAO by focusing on the well-known effect of histamine on gut motility. Using ex vivo and in vitro assays, we found that vDAO is more potent than commercial anti-histamine drugs at inhibiting histamine-induced contraction of murine distal colon muscles. We also identified pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (the biologically active form of vitamin B6) as an effective enhancer of vDAO antispasmodic activity. Furthermore, we discovered that rectally administered vDAO can be retained on gut mucosa and remain active. These observations make administration of vDAO in the gut lumen a valid alternative treatment for histamine-induced intestinal dysfunctions.},

Nowadays, some researches study the role of the N-linked glycans as potential targets for vaccines and new agents. Due to the flexibility and diversity of the N-linked glycans, in this work, we focus on the N-Acetylglucosamine moiety, which is the precursor of nearly all eukaryotic glycans. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the effects of the N-Acetylglucosamine on the stability of the spike glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2. After a 100 ns of simulation on the spike proteins without and with the N-Acetylglucosamine molecules, we found that the presence of N-Acetylglucosamine increases the local stability in their vicinity; even though their effect on the full structure is negligible. Thus; it can be inferred that the N-Acetylglucosamine moieties can potentially affect the interaction of the S protein with the ACE2 receptor. We also found that the S1 domain is more flexible than the S2 domain. We propose which of the experimentally observed glycans found on the spike may be more functional than the others. Detailed understanding of glycans is key for the development of new therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {Humans have three functioning genes that code for copper-containing amine oxidases. The product of the AOC1 gene is a so-called diamine oxidase (hDAO), named for its substrate preference for diamines, particularly histamine. hDAO has been cloned and expressed in insect cells and the structure of the native enzyme determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.8 Å. The homodimeric structure has the archetypal amine oxidase fold. Two active sites, one in each subunit, are characterized by the presence of a copper ion and a topaquinone residue formed by the post-translational modification of a tyrosine. Although hDAO shares 37.9 \% sequence identity with another human copper amine oxidase, semicarbazide sensitive amine oxidase or vascular adhesion protein-1, its substrate binding pocket and entry channel are distinctly different in accord with the different substrate specificities. The structures of two inhibitor complexes of hDAO, berenil and pentamidine, have been refined to resolutions of 2.1 Å and 2.2 Å, respectively. They bind non-covalently in the active site channel. The inhibitor binding suggests that an aspartic acid residue, conserved in all diamine oxidases but absent from other amine oxidases, is responsible for the diamine specificity by interacting with the second amino group of preferred diamine substrates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Copper amine oxidases are a ubiquitous and novel group of quinoenzymes that catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary amines to the corresponding aldehydes, with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The enzymes are dimers of identical 70-90 kDa subunits, each of which contains a single copper ion and a covalently bound cofactor formed by the post-translational modification of a tyrosine side chain to 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ).
RESULTS: The crystal structure of amine oxidase from Escherichia coli has been determined in both an active and an inactive form. The only structural differences are in the active site, where differences in copper coordination geometry and in the position and interactions of the redox cofactor, TPQ, are observed. Each subunit of the mushroom-shaped dimer comprises four domains: a 440 amino acid C-terminal beta sandwich domain, which contains the active site and provides the dimer interface, and three smaller peripheral alpha/beta domains (D1-D3), each of about 100 amino acids. D2 and D3 show remarkable structural and sequence similarity to each other and are conserved throughout the quinoenzyme family. In contrast, D1 is absent from some amine oxidases. The active sites are well buried from solvent and lie some 35 A apart, connected by a pair of beta hairpin arms.
CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of E. coli copper amine oxidase reveals a number of unexpected features and provides a basis for investigating the intriguing similarities and differences in catalytic mechanism of members of this enzyme family. In addition to the three conserved histidines that bind the copper, our studies identify a number of other conserved residues close to the active site, including a candidate for the catalytic base and a fourth conserved histidine which is involved in an interesting intersubunit interaction.},

Electron-density difference maps and crystallographic refinement provide unequivocal evidence for a number of Xe-binding sites in each enzyme. Only one of these sites is present in all three Cu amine oxidases studied. Structural changes elsewhere in the protein molecules are insignificant. The results illustrate the use of xenon as a probe for cavities, in which a protein may accommodate a dioxygen molecule. The finding of a potential dioxygen-binding cavity close to the active site of Cu amine oxidases may be relevant to the function of the enzymes, since the formation of a transient protein–dioxygen complex is a likely step in the catalytic mechanism. No evidence was found for xenon binding in a region of the molecule that was previously identified in two other Cu amine oxidases as a potential transient dioxygen-binding site.},

The 1680 bp long MaCAO was successfully cloned (GenBank accession no: MH205733). Subsequently, MaCAO was heterologously expressed using a recombinant plasmid, pET-22b (+)/MaCAO in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). A protein with a molecular mass of 62.9 kDa was obtained, whose function was validated through enzymatic reaction. Bioinformatics analysis identified that MaCAO contained the same conserved domain as that of copper amine oxidases (“NYDY”). Furthermore, the tertiary structure of the predicted protein using homology modeling revealed 46\% similarity with that of copper amine oxidase (Protein Data Bank ID: 1W2Z). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the enzymatic reaction revealed that MaCAO could catalyze 1,5-pentanediamine to produce 5-aminopentanal. Additionally, levels of mulberry leaf DNJ content were significantly positively correlated with expression levels of MaCAO (P {\textless} 0.001). Our results conclude that MaCAO is the key enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway of DNJ. The function of MaCAO is validated, providing a foundation for the further analysis of biosynthetic pathways of DNJ in mulberry leaves using tools of synthetic biology.},

The broad diversity of biochemical functions that carbohydrates cover is a direct consequence of the variety of 3D architectures they can adopt, displaying branched or linear arrangements, widely ranging in sizes, and with the highest diversity of building blocks of any other natural biopolymer. Despite this unparalleled complexity, a common denominator can be found in the glycans’ inherent flexibility, which hinders experimental characterization, but that can be addressed by high-performance computing (HPC)-based molecular simulations. In this short review, I present and discuss the state-of-the-art of molecular simulations of complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates, highlighting methodological strengths and weaknesses, important insights through emblematic case studies, and suggesting perspectives for future developments.},

	abstract = {P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the ATP binding cassette superfamily of transporters, and it is a xenobiotic efflux pump that limits intracellular drug accumulation by pumping compounds out of cells. P-gp contributes to a reduction in toxicity, and has broad substrate specificity. It is involved in the failure of many cancer and antiviral chemotherapies due to the phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR), in which the membrane transporter removes chemotherapeutic drugs from target cells. Understanding the details of the ligand–P-gp interaction is therefore critical for the development of drugs that can overcome the MDR phenomenon, for the early identification of P-gp substrates that will help us to obtain a more effective prediction of toxicity, and for the subsequent outdesign of substrate properties if needed. In this work, a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of human P-gp (hP-gp) in an explicit membrane-and-water environment were performed to investigate the effects of binding different compounds on the conformational dynamics of P-gp. The results revealed significant differences in the behaviour of P-gp in the presence of active and non-active compounds within the binding pocket, as different patterns of movement were identified that could be correlated with conformational changes leading to the activation of the translocation mechanism. The predicted ligand–P-gp interactions are in good agreement with the available experimental data, as well as the estimation of the binding-free energies of the studied complexes, demonstrating the validity of the results derived from the MD simulations.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used extensively to study P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a flexible multidrug transporter that is a key player in the development of multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutics. A substantial body of literature has grown from simulation studies that have employed various simulation conditions and parameters, including AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, GROMOS, and coarse-grained force fields, drawing conclusions from simulations spanning hundreds of nanoseconds. Each force field is typically parametrized and validated on different data and observables, usually of small molecules and peptides; there have been few comparisons of force field performance on large protein–membrane systems. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of P-gp embedded in a POPC/cholesterol bilayer generated over 500 ns of replicate simulation with five force fields from popular biomolecular families: AMBER 99SB-ILDN, CHARMM 36, OPLS-AA/L, GROMOS 54A7, and MARTINI. We find considerable differences among the ensembles with little conformational overlap, although they correspond to similar extents to structural data obtained from electron paramagnetic resonance and cross-linking studies. Moreover, each trajectory was still sampling new conformations at a high rate after 500 ns of simulation, suggesting the need for more sampling. This work highlights the need to consider known limitations of the force field used (e.g., biases toward certain secondary structures) and the simulation itself (e.g., whether sufficient sampling has been achieved) when interpreting accumulated results of simulation studies of P-gp and other transport proteins.},

Nowadays, some researches study the role of the N-linked glycans as potential targets for vaccines and new agents. Due to the flexibility and diversity of the N-linked glycans, in this work, we focus on the N-Acetylglucosamine moiety, which is the precursor of nearly all eukaryotic glycans. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the effects of the N-Acetylglucosamine on the stability of the spike glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2. After a 100 ns of simulation on the spike proteins without and with the N-Acetylglucosamine molecules, we found that the presence of N-Acetylglucosamine increases the local stability in their vicinity; even though their effect on the full structure is negligible. Thus; it can be inferred that the N-Acetylglucosamine moieties can potentially affect the interaction of the S protein with the ACE2 receptor. We also found that the S1 domain is more flexible than the S2 domain. We propose which of the experimentally observed glycans found on the spike may be more functional than the others. Detailed understanding of glycans is key for the development of new therapeutic strategies.},

Microcalorimetry has found the complex-type N-linked glycan core pentasaccharide ␤-GlcNAc-(132)-␣-Man-(133)-[␤-GlcNAc-(132)-␣-Man-(136)]-Man to bind to the lectin, Concanavalin A, with almost the same affinity as the trimannoside, Man-␣-(136)-[Man-␣-(133)]-Man. Recent determination of the structure of the pentasaccharide complex found a glycosidic linkage ␺ torsion angle to be distorted by 50° from the NMR solution value and perturbation of some key mannose–protein interactions observed in the structures of the mono- and trimannoside complexes. To unravel the free energy contributions to binding and to determine the structural basis for this degeneracy, we present the results of a series of nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations, coupled to analysis via the recently developed MM-GB/SA approach (Srinivasan et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120:9401–9409). These calculations indicate that the strength of key mannose–protein interactions at the monosaccharide site is preserved in both the oligosaccharides. Although distortion of the pentasaccharide is significant, the principal factor in reduced binding is incomplete offset of ligand and protein desolvation due to poorly matched polar interactions. This analysis implies that, although Concanavalin A tolerates the additional 6 arm GlcNAc present in the pentasaccharide, it does not serve as a key recognition determinant.},

Salmonella SseK1 and SseK2 are E. coli NleB1 orthologs that behave as NleB1-like GTs, although they differ in protein substrate specificity. Here we report that these enzymes are retaining glycosyltransferases composed of a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, a lid domain, and a catalytic domain. A conserved HEN motif (His-Glu-Asn) in the active site is important for enzyme catalysis and bacterial virulence. We observe differences between SseK1 and SseK2 in interactions with substrates and identify substrate residues that are critical for enzyme recognition. Long Molecular Dynamics simulations suggest that the HLH domain determines substrate specificity and the lid-domain regulates the opening of the active site. Overall, our data suggest a front-face SNi mechanism, explain differences in activities among these effectors, and have implications for future drug development against enteric pathogens.},

N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) deficiency is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental delay, peripheral neuropathy, elevated liver transaminases, hyperkinetic movement disorder and (hypo)-alacrima. We demonstrate that N-acetylglucosamine-asparagine (GlcNAc-Asn; GNA), is the analyte most closely associated with NGLY1 deficiency, showing consistent separation in levels between patients and controls. GNA accumulation is directly linked to the absence of functional NGLY1, presenting strong potential for its use as a biomarker. In agreement, a quantitative liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assay, developed to assess GNA from 3 to 3000 ng/ml, showed that it is conserved as a marker for loss of NGLY1 function in NGLY1-deficient cell lines, rodents (urine, cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and tissues) and patients (plasma and urine). Elevated GNA levels differentiate patients from controls, are stable over time and correlate with changes in NGLY1 activity. GNA as a biomarker has the potential to identify and validate patients with NGLY1 deficiency, act as a direct pharmacodynamic marker and serve as a potential surrogate endpoint in clinical trials.,

Recent breakthroughs in protein purification strategies and current proteome technologies make it possible to identify the proteomics of healthy and diseased retinas. Despite these advantages, the research field identifying sets of posttranslationally modified proteins (PTMomes) related to diseased retinas is significantly lagging, despite knowledge of the major retina PTMome being critical to drug development. In this review, we highlight current updates regarding the PTMomes in three retinal degenerative diseases—namely, diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A literature search reveals the necessity to expedite investigations into essential PTMomes in the diseased retina and validate their physiological roles. This knowledge would accelerate the development of treatments for retinal degenerative disorders and the prevention of blindness in affected populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship of immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation with diabetes and diabetic nephropathy has been reported, but its role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate and validate the association of IgG glycosylation with DR.
METHODS: We analyzed the IgG N-linked glycosylation profile and primarily selected candidate glycans by lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression analysis in the discovery population. The findings were validated in the replication population using a binary logistics model. The association between the significant glycosylation panel and clinical features was illustrated with Spearman's coefficient. The results were confirmed by sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Among 16 selected glycan candidates using lasso, two IgG glycans (GP15, GP20) and two derived traits (IGP32, IGP54) were identified and validated to be significantly associated with DR (P {\textless} .05), and the combined adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 0.587, 0.613, 1.970, and 0.593, respectively. The glycosylation panel showed a weak correlation with clinical features, except for age. In addition, the results remained consistent when the subjects with prediabetes were excluded from the controls, and the adjusted ORs were 0.677, 0.738, 1.597, and 0.678 in the whole population. Furthermore, in the 1:3 rematched population, a significant association was observed, apart from GP20.
CONCLUSIONS: The IgG glycosylation profile, reflecting an aging and pro-inflammatory status, was significantly associated with DR. The variation in the IgG glycome deserves more attention in diabetic complications.},

Numerous studies have confirmed that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the occurrence and progression of cancers in multiple systems throughout the body. It is also involved in regulating multiple cancer hallmarks, such as metabolic reprogramming, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this review, we first describe the process of O-GlcNAcylation and the structure and function of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes.

Its effect on the protein conformational transitions is not clearly understood yet. In this study, we have examined the effect of glycosylation on protein stability using molecular dynamics simulation of legume lectin soybean agglutinin (SBA). Its glycosylated moiety consists of high mannose type N-linked glycan (Man9GlcNAc2). To unveil the structural perturbations during thermal unfolding of these two forms, we have studied and compared them to the experimental results. From the perspective of dynamics, our simulations revealed that the nonglycosylated monomeric form is less stable than corresponding glycosylated form at normal and elevated temperatures. Moreover, at elevated temperature thermal destabilization is more prominent in solvent exposed loops, turns and ends of distinct β sheets. SBA maintains it folded structure due to some important saltbridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions within the protein. The reducing terminal GlcNAc residues interact with the protein residues VAL161, PRO182 and SER225 via hydrophobic and via hydrogen bonding with ASN 9 and ASN 75. Our simulations also revealed that single glycosylation (ASN75) has no significant effect on corresponding cis peptide angle orientation. This atomistic description might have important implications for understanding the functionality and stability of Soybean agglutinin.},

O-Linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a dynamic nucleocytoplasmic modification more analogous to phosphorylation than to classical complex O-glycosylation. We describe a mass spectrometry-based method for the identification of sites modified by O-GlcNAc that relies on mild β-elimination followed by Michael addition with dithiothreitol (BEMAD). Using synthetic peptides, we also show that biotin pentylamine can replace dithiothreitol as the nucleophile. The modified peptides can be efficiently enriched by affinity chromatography, and the sites can be mapped using tandem mass spectrometry. This same methodology can be applied to mapping sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation, and we provide a strategy that uses modification-specific antibodies and enzymes to discriminate between the two post-translational modifications. The BEMAD methodology was validated by mapping three previously identified O-GlcNAc sites, as well as three novel sites, on Synapsin I purified from rat brain. BEMAD was then used on a purified nuclear pore complex preparation to map novel sites of O-GlcNAc modification on the Lamin B receptor and the nucleoporin Nup155. This method is amenable for performing quantitative mass spectrometry and can also be adapted to quantify cysteine residues. In addition, our studies emphasize the importance of distinguishing between O-phosphate versus O-GlcNAc when mapping sites of serine and threonine post-translational modification using β-elimination/Michael addition methods.},

Here, we report and validate force field parameters (GROMOS 45a3 and 54a7) required to run and analyze MD simulations of more than 250 different types of enzymatic and non-enzymatic PTMs. The newly developed GROMOS 54a7 parameters in particular exhibit near chemical accuracy in matching experimentally measured hydration free energies (RMSE = 4.2 kJ/mol over the validation set). Using this tool, we quantitatively show that the majority of PTMs greatly alter the hydrophobicity and other physico-chemical properties of target amino acids, with the extent of change in many cases being comparable to the complete range spanned by native amino acids.},

There is considerable interest in developments of general approaches to predict the structural consequences of site-specific glycosylation and to understand how these effects can be exploited in protein design with advantageous properties. In this study, the impacts of N-glycans on protein structure and dynamics are systematically investigated using an integrated computational approach of the Protein Data Bank structure analysis and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins. Our study reveals that N-glycosylation does not induce significant changes in protein structure, but decreases protein dynamics, likely leading to an increase in protein stability. Overall, these results suggest not only a common role of glycosylation in proteins, but also a need for certain proteins to be properly glycosylated to gain their intrinsic dynamic properties.},

The results suggest the structured part of the protein, HuPrP(127–227) is stabilized overall from addition of the glycans, specifically by extensions of Helix-B and Helix-C and reduced flexibility of the linking turn containing Asn197, although some regions such as residues in the turn (165–170) between Strand-B and Helix-B have increased flexibility. The stabilization appears indirect, by reducing the mobility of the surrounding water molecules, and not from specific interactions such as H bonds or ion pairs. The results are consistent with glycosylation at Asn197 having a stabilizing role, while that at Asn181, in a region with already stable secondary structure, having a more functional role, in agreement with literature suggestions. Due to three negatively charged SiaLex groups per N-glycan, the surface electrostatic properties change to a negative electrostatic field covering most of the C-terminal part, including the surface of Helix-B and Helix-C, while the positively charged N-terminal part PrP(90–126) of undefined structure creates a positive potential. The unusual hydrophilic Helix-A (144–152) is not covered by either of these dominant electrostatic fields, and modeling shows it could readily dimerize in anti parallel fashion. In combination with separate simulations of the GPI anchor in a membrane model, the results show the GPI anchor is highly flexible and would maintain the protein at a distance between 9 and 13 Å from the membrane surface, with little influence on its structure or orientational freedom.},

In cells they are involved in, e.g., energy storage, signaling, and cell–cell recognition. All of these phenomena take place in atomistic scales, thus atomistic simulation would be the method of choice to explore how carbohydrates function. However, the progress in the field is limited by the lack of appropriate tools for preparing carbohydrate structures and related topology files for the simulation models. Here we present tools that fill this gap. Applications where the tools discussed in this paper are particularly useful include, among others, the preparation of structures for glycolipids, nanocellulose, and glycans linked to glycoproteins. The molecular structures and simulation files generated by the tools are compatible with GROMACS.},

              -linked glycosylation in the secretory compartments of eukaryotic cells is the sequential remodeling of an initially uniform oligosaccharide to a site-specific, heterogeneous ensemble of glycostructures on mature proteins. To understand site-specific processing, we used protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a model protein with five glycosylation sites, for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and compared the result to a biochemical
              in vitro
              analysis with four different glycan processing enzymes. As predicted by an analysis of the accessibility of the

              N
              -glycans at different glycosylation sites showed different kinetic properties for the processing enzymes. In addition, altering the tertiary structure of the glycoprotein PDI affected its

              -glycan remodeling in a site-specific way. We propose that the observed differential

Ribonuclease 1 (RNase 1), which is the human homologue of the archetypal enzyme RNase A, undergoes N-linked glycosylation at asparagine residues 34, 76, and 88. We have produced the three individual glycoforms that display the core heptasaccharide, Man5GlcNAc2, and analyzed the structure of each glycoform by using small-angle X-ray scattering along with molecular dynamics simulations. The glycan on Asn34 is relatively compact and rigid, donates hydrogen bonds that “cap” the carbonyl groups at the C-terminus of an α-helix, and enhances protein thermostability. In contrast, the glycan on Asn88 is flexible and can even enter the enzymic active site, hindering catalysis. The N-glycosylation of Asn76 has less pronounced consequences. These data highlight the diverse behaviors of Man5GlcNAc2 pendants and provide a structural underpinning to the functional consequences of protein glycosylation.},

	abstract = {Protein glycosylation is a common post-translational modification, the effect of which on protein conformational and stability is incompletely understood. Here we have investigated the effects of glycosylation on the thermostability of Bacillus subtilis xylanase A (XynA) expressed in Pichia pastoris. Intact mass analysis of the heterologous wild-type XynA revealed two, three, or four Hex8–16GlcNAc2 modifications involving asparagine residues at positions 20, 25, 141, and 181. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the XynA modified with various combinations of branched Hex9GlcNAc2 at these positions indicated a significant contribution from protein-glycan interactions to the overall energy of the glycoproteins. The effect of glycan content and glycosylation position on protein stability was evaluated by combinatorial mutagenesis of all six potential N-glycosylation sites. The majority of glycosylated enzymes expressed in P. pastoris presented increased thermostability in comparison with their unglycosylated counterparts expressed in Escherichia coli. Steric effects of multiple glycosylation events were apparent, and glycosylation position rather than the number of glycosylation events determined increases in thermostability. The MD simulations also indicated that clustered glycan chains tended to favor less stabilizing glycan-glycan interactions, whereas more dispersed glycosylation patterns favored stabilizing protein-glycan interactions. Background: The molecular basis of increased protein stability by N-glycosylation is incompletely understood. Results: Glycosylation position rather than number is more important for protein thermostability in the xylanase A from Bacillus subtilis. Conclusion: Glycans contribute both to stabilizing protein-glycan and less favorable glycan-glycan interactions. An extensive protein-glycan interface favors protein stability. Significance: Formation of a protein-glycan interface provides a conceptual framework to understand glycoprotein stabilization.},

Computer simulations may be used to model glycosylated proteins but require hundreds of thousands of computing hours on supercomputers, thus limiting routine use. Here, we describe GlycoSHIELD, a reductionist method that can be implemented on personal computers to graft realistic ensembles of glycan conformers onto static protein structures in minutes. Using molecular dynamics simulation, small-angle X-ray scattering, cryoelectron microscopy, and mass spectrometry, we show that this open-access toolkit provides enhanced models of glycoprotein structures.

GAGs are heterogeneous, conformationally complex, and polydisperse, containing up to 200 monosaccharide units. These complexities make studying GAG conformation a challenge for existing experimental and computational methods. We previously described an algorithm we developed that applies conformational parameters (i.e., all bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles) from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of nonsulfated chondroitin GAG 20-mers to construct 3-D atomic-resolution models of nonsulfated chondroitin GAGs of arbitrary length. In the current study, we applied our algorithm to other GAGs, including hyaluronan and nonsulfated forms of dermatan, keratan, and heparan and expanded our database of MD-generated GAG conformations. Here, we show that individual glycosidic linkages and monosaccharide rings in 10- and 20-mers of hyaluronan and nonsulfated dermatan, keratan, and heparan behave randomly and independently in MD simulation and, therefore, using a database of MD-generated 20-mer conformations, that our algorithm can construct conformational ensembles of 10- and 20-mers of various GAG types that accurately represent the backbone flexibility seen in MD simulations. Furthermore, our algorithm efficiently constructs conformational ensembles of GAG 200-mers that we would reasonably expect from MD simulations.},

The X-ray structures for both human enzymes are solved and provide the basis for computer-aided inhibitor design, which has been reported by several research groups. Although the putative off-target effect of hDAO is less studied, computational methods could be easily utilized to avoid the binding of VAP-1-targeted inhibitors to hDAO. The choice of the model organism for preclinical testing of hVAP-1 inhibitors is not either trivial due to species-specific binding properties of designed inhibitors and different repertoire of copper-containing amine oxidase family members in mammalian species. Thus, the facts that should be considered in hVAP-1-targeted inhibitor design are discussed in light of the applied structural bioinformatics and structural biology approaches.},

The product of the AOC1 gene is a so-called diamine oxidase (hDAO), named for its substrate preference for diamines, particularly histamine. hDAO has been cloned and expressed in insect cells and the structure of the native enzyme determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.8 Å. The homodimeric structure has the archetypal amine oxidase fold. Two active sites, one in each subunit, are characterized by the presence of a copper ion and a topaquinone residue formed by the post-translational modification of a tyrosine. Although hDAO shares 37.9 \% sequence identity with another human copper amine oxidase, semicarbazide sensitive amine oxidase or vascular adhesion protein-1, its substrate binding pocket and entry channel are distinctly different in accord with the different substrate specificities. The structures of two inhibitor complexes of hDAO, berenil and pentamidine, have been refined to resolutions of 2.1 Å and 2.2 Å, respectively. They bind non-covalently in the active site channel. The inhibitor binding suggests that an aspartic acid residue, conserved in all diamine oxidases but absent from other amine oxidases, is responsible for the diamine specificity by interacting with the second amino group of preferred diamine substrates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Copper amine oxidases are a ubiquitous and novel group of quinoenzymes that catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary amines to the corresponding aldehydes, with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The enzymes are dimers of identical 70-90 kDa subunits, each of which contains a single copper ion and a covalently bound cofactor formed by the post-translational modification of a tyrosine side chain to 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ).
RESULTS: The crystal structure of amine oxidase from Escherichia coli has been determined in both an active and an inactive form. The only structural differences are in the active site, where differences in copper coordination geometry and in the position and interactions of the redox cofactor, TPQ, are observed. Each subunit of the mushroom-shaped dimer comprises four domains: a 440 amino acid C-terminal beta sandwich domain, which contains the active site and provides the dimer interface, and three smaller peripheral alpha/beta domains (D1-D3), each of about 100 amino acids. D2 and D3 show remarkable structural and sequence similarity to each other and are conserved throughout the quinoenzyme family. In contrast, D1 is absent from some amine oxidases. The active sites are well buried from solvent and lie some 35 A apart, connected by a pair of beta hairpin arms.
CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of E. coli copper amine oxidase reveals a number of unexpected features and provides a basis for investigating the intriguing similarities and differences in catalytic mechanism of members of this enzyme family. In addition to the three conserved histidines that bind the copper, our studies identify a number of other conserved residues close to the active site, including a candidate for the catalytic base and a fourth conserved histidine which is involved in an interesting intersubunit interaction.},

The study combines the use of NMR spectroscopy experiments with extensive MD simulations in explicit water. Notably, the presence of a key hydrogen bond between the receptor and the OMe group of the ?-O-GlcNAc-OMe derivative appears to be responsible for the high selectivity observed for this compound. In addition, to study the effect on the binding of the underlying amino acid, we have prepared different model glycopeptides, which include the non-natural α-methylserine and α-methylthreonine as underlying amino acids. Interestingly, the presence of a methyl group decreases the affinity constant, especially in those cases in which a ?-methyl group is present. As a result, the serine-containing glycopeptide exhibited the highest affinity constant of the glycopeptides, and the threonine derivative showed the lowest one. This low selectivity could have its origin in the difficulty to form both specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic (CH-π) contacts.},

	title = {Crystal structure of a eukaryotic (pea seedling) copper- containing amine oxidase at 2.2 Å resolution},
	abstract = {Background: Copper-containing amine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary amines to aldehydes, in a reaction that requires free radicals. These enzymes are important in many biological processes, including cell differentiation and growth, wound healing, detoxification and signalling. The catalytic reaction requires a redox cofactor, topa quinone (TPQ), which is derived by post-translational modification of an invariant tyrosine residue. Both the biogenesis of the TPQ cofactor and the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme require the presence of a copper atom at the active site. The crystal structure of a prokaryotic copper amine oxidase from E. coli (ECAO) has recently been reported.
Results: The first structure of a eukaryotic (pea seedling) amine oxidase (PSAO) has been solved and refined at 2.2 Å resolution. The crystallographic phases were derived from a single phosphotungstic acid derivative. The positions of the tungsten atoms in the W12 clusters were obtained by molecular replacement using E. coli amine oxidase as a search model. The methodology avoided bias from the search model, and provides an essentially independent view of a eukaryotic amine oxidase. The PSAO molecule is a homodimer; each subunit has three domains. The active site of each subunit lies near an edge of the ␤-sandwich of the largest domain, but is not accessible from the solvent. The essential active-site copper atom is coordinated by three histidine side chains and two water molecules in an approximately square-pyramidal arrangement. All the atoms of the TPQ cofactor are unambiguously defined, the shortest distance to the copper atom being {\textasciitilde}6 Å.

Conclusions: There is considerable structural homology between PSAO and ECAO. A combination of evidence from both structures indicates that the TPQ side chain is sufficiently flexible to permit the aromatic group to rotate about the C␤–C␥ bond, and to move between bonding and non-bonding positions with respect to the Cu atom. Conformational flexibility is also required at the surface of the molecule to allow the substrates access to the active site, which is inaccessible to solvent, as expected for an enzyme that uses radical chemistry.},

	abstract = {Trehalose is a ubiquitous molecule that occurs in lower and higher life forms but not in mammals. Till about 40 years ago, trehalose was visualized as a storage molecule, aiding the release of glucose for carrying out cellular functions. This perception has now changed dramatically. The role of trehalose has expanded, and this molecule has now been implicated in a variety of situations. Trehalose is synthesized as a stress-responsive factor when cells are exposed to environmental stresses like heat, cold, oxidation, desiccation, and so forth. When unicellular organisms are exposed to stress, they adapt by synthesizing huge amounts of trehalose, which helps them in retaining cellular integrity. This is thought to occur by prevention of denaturation of proteins by trehalose, which would otherwise degrade under stress. This explanation may be rational, since recently, trehalose has been shown to slow down the rate of polyglutamine-mediated protein aggregation and the resultant pathogenesis by stabilizing an aggregation-prone model protein. In recent years, trehalose has also proved useful in the cryopreservation of sperm and stem cells and in the development of a highly reliable organ preservation solution. This review aims to highlight the changing perception of the role of trehalose over the last 10 years and to propose common mechanisms that may be involved in all the myriad ways in which trehalose stabilizes protein structures. These will take into account the structure of trehalose molecule and its interactions with its environment, and the explanations will focus on the role of trehalose in preventing protein denaturation.},

About 50\% aggregation of BSA was observed at a moisture level of 8μl/10mg protein. Including trehalose in the protein sample caused a significant reduction in aggregation. We address the probable mechanisms for the protective effect of trehalose by considering the various hypotheses that have been proposed in the literature. The techniques that have been used include denaturing and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence. The nature of the aggregates was studied by carrying out electrophoresis of the aggregated protein in the presence of reducing and chaotropic reagents. The interaction studies of aggregated BSA with Thioflavin T and CongoRed indicate the possibility of amyloid type of character in the former. These studies may explain the protective role of trehalose under conditions where the storage stability of therapeutic proteins is compromised.},

	abstract = {Trehalose, a naturally occurring osmolyte, is known to be an exceptional stabilizer of proteins and helps retain the activity of enzymes in solution as well as in the freeze-dried state. To understand the mechanism of action of trehalose in detail, we have conducted a thorough investigation of its effect on the thermal stability in aqueous solutions of five well characterized proteins differing in their various physico-chemical properties. Among them, RNase A has been used as a model enzyme to investigate the effect of trehalose on the retention of enzymatic activity upon incubation at high temperatures. 2 m trehalose was observed to raise the transition temperature, Tm of RNase A by as much as 18 degrees C and Gibbs free energy by 4.8 kcal mol-1 at pH 2.5. There is a decrease in the heat capacity of protein denaturation (DeltaCp) in trehalose solutions for all the studied proteins. An increase in the DeltaG and a decrease in the DeltaCp values for all the proteins points toward a general mechanism of stabilization due to the elevation and broadening of the stability curve (DeltaG versus T). A direct correlation of the surface tension of trehalose solutions and the thermal stability of various proteins has been observed. Wyman linkage analysis indicates that at 1.5 m concentration 4-7 molecules of trehalose are excluded from the vicinity of protein molecules upon denaturation. We further show that an increase in the stability of proteins in the presence of trehalose depends upon the length of the polypeptide chain. The pH dependence data suggest that even though the charge status of a protein contributes significantly, trehalose can be expected to work as a universal stabilizer of protein conformation due to its exceptional effect on the structure and properties of solvent water compared with other sugars and polyols.},

	abstract = {The effect of glucose (0–15 mass\%) on the kinetics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) denatured aggregation at high concentration in aqueous solution has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The observed denatured aggregation process was irreversible and could be characterized by a denaturation temperature (Tm), apparent activation energy (Ea), the approximate order of reaction, and pre-exponential factor (A). As the glucose concentration increased from 0 to 15 mass\%, Tm increased, Ea also increased from 514.59409±6.61489 to 548.48611±7.81302 kJ mol–1, and A/s–1 increased from 1.24239E79 to 5.59975E83. The stabilization increased with an increasing concentration of glucose, which was attributed to its ability to alter protein denatured aggregation kinetics. The kinetic analysis was carried out using a composite procedure involving the iso-conversional method and the master plots method. The iso-conversional method indicated that denatured aggregation of BSA in the presence and absence of glucose should conform to single reaction model. The master plots method suggested that the simple order reaction model best describe the process. This study shows the combination of iso-conversional method and the master plots method can be used to quantitatively model the denatured aggregation mechanism of the BSA in the presence and absence of glucose.},
